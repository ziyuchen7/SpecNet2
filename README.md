# SpecNet2
Code for SpecNet2

Folder 'batch_run' stores the data and MATLAB code for figure generations; folder 'python' contains Python files for SpecNet2 (and SpecNet1); folder 'matlab' contains MATLAB files for the linear algebra version of SpecNet2 (and SpecNet1).


Packages for the python virtual environment are listed in "./python/requirement.txt". To train a network, run the command -- python main.py para.json (or mnist_para.json). Network architecture and hyperparameters are encoded in the json files.
